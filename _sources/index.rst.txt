Welcome to Approximate Engineering's Python Game Controller Documentation!
==========================================================================

.. note::

    This documentation, and the code it documents, is the original SixAxis controller code from my PiWars_ 2015 robot,
    Triangula. It has subsequently been extensively modified, and now supports the PS4 and XBox One controllers in
    addition to the original support for PS3 controllers.

    - Version 1.0.2 has support for the Rock Candy PS3 clones thanks to Keith Ellis.

    - Version 1.0.4 supports the Steam Controller from Valve, although it needs an extra third party user space driver
      (see :ref:`steam-controller-label`)

Getting the code
----------------

You can install the code using pip, you'll have to add a few native libraries first though:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip gcc
    $ pip install approxeng.input

(The exact dependencies may vary depending on your operating system, they come from using evdev and having to compile
that particular python module against whatever underlying libraries your OS is using). I *strongly* recommend using a
virtual environment (virtualenv) so you don't have to install python libraries as root.

.. note::

    The controller support code is written in Python, but relies on some underlying operating system functionality which
    is exclusive to Linux based computers like the Pi. As a result, it won't work on Windows or OSX. If you need to
    handle joysticks on those platforms I recommend taking a look at PyGame_, which includes joystick support amongst
    its other functionality.

To work with the code on other platforms you'll want to clone it from GitHub_, it's available under the ASL, the same as
almost everything Python based. Documentation (this site) is generated using Sphinx.
