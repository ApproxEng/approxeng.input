Adding support for a new controller type
========================================

The library supports a number of controllers but it's quite possible, given the variety of cheap clones on the market,
that your particular controller isn't one of them. You have a few options, depending on the scenario you find yourself
in:

Clones of a supported controller
--------------------------------

If you have a controller which is an exact copy of one the library supports, but isn't autodetected, you can either bind
it yourself, using the class from the library which most closely matches your controller, or you can add autodetect
support to the library, again using the existing class. This might happen if you have, say, a clone PS4 controller which
is identical in every way but which has a different USB vendor and product identifier.

The :module:`approxeng.input.controllers` module contains a static, `CONTROLLERS`.
