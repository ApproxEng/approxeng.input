Welcome to Approximate Engineering's Python Game Controller Documentation!
==========================================================================

This library simplifies access to the axes and buttons on game controller hardware from Python. It was originally
written to support my PiWars_ robots, and remains focused on similar projects, but can be used wherever game controller
functionality is required. The current code only supports Linux based systems, including the Raspberry Pi.

In general you don't need to code to a specific controller, but some may need extra steps when connecting to your Pi or
other computer. In other cases, some controllers offer unique features such as the PS4's light bar. You can see more
details for specific controller types at the following:

- Mike Horne (`\@recantha <https://twitter.com/recantha>`__) add support for the PiHut_ controller and an example for
  the :ref:`example_camjam`

Getting the code
----------------

You can install the code using pip, you'll have to add a few native libraries first though:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip gcc
    $ pip install approxeng.input

(The exact dependencies may vary depending on your operating system, they come from using evdev and having to compile
that particular python module against whatever underlying libraries your OS is using). I *strongly* recommend using a
virtual environment (virtualenv) so you don't have to install python libraries as root.

.. note::

    The controller support code is written in Python, but relies on some underlying operating system functionality which
    is exclusive to Linux based computers like the Pi. As a result, it won't work on Windows or OSX. If you need to
    handle joysticks on those platforms I recommend taking a look at PyGame_, which includes joystick support amongst
    its other functionality.

To work with the code on other platforms you'll want to clone it from GitHub_, it's available under the ASL, the same as
almost everything Python based. Documentation (this site) is generated using Sphinx.
