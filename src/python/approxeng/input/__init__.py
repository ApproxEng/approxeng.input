    a low value signal as opposed to a high value one (which could include a high negative value). Note that bad things
    happen if dead_zone + hot_zone == 1.0, so don't do that. This is used by the map_dual_axis call, but can also be

            names which do not appear in this map are not assigned a prefix, so it's legitimate to only assign
