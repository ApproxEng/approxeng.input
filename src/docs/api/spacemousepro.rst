    SpaceMouse Pro Controller

This is a driver for the 3dConnexion SpaceMouse Pro, I've only tested this with the wired version. Maybe not so useful
for robots but if you have one of these controllers the library can now drive it properly! Note that because this is so
very different from the other joypad style controllers it doesn't have the same set of controls available. Check the
source for the driver to see exactly what controls are supported.
