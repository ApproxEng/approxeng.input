Steam Controller Support
========================

The Valve Steam controller is a strange beast, intended as it is to allow control of games which never expected to use
a controller. Because of this the actual hardware and the way it interacts with the system is a little different to a
regular game controller, and we have to use an additional driver which pulls information from the controller and pushes
it to a virtual device to which we then bind.
