API Documentation
=================

Triangula's code is intended to be useful, both directly for cases where you may have similar requirements, and
indirectly as an example of how to solve the kinds of problems I've encountered while building her. As such the code
is very heavily commented - you should hopefully find it largely self explanatory although you'll need at least a
reasonable level of Python knowledge.
