# Code for Brian Corteil's Tiny 4WD robot, based on code from Brian as modified by Emma Norling.
# Subsequently modified by Tom Oinn to add dummy functions when no explorer hat is available,
# use any available joystick, use the new function in 1.0.6 of approxeng.input to get multiple
# axis values in a single call, use implicit de-structuring of tuples to reduce verbosity, add
# an exception to break out of the control loop on pressing HOME etc.

    # that doesn't have the library, we create dummy functions for set_speeds and stop_motors which
    # just print out what they'd have done. This is a fairly common way to deal with hardware that
    # may or may not exist! Obviously if you're actually running this on one of Brian's robots you
    # should have the Explorer HAT libraries installed, this is really just so I can test on my big
    # linux desktop machine when coding.
