Change Log
==========

.. note::

    This documentation, and the code it documents, is the original SixAxis controller code from my PiWars_ 2015 robot,
    Triangula. It has subsequently been extensively modified, and now supports the PS4 and XBox One controllers in
    addition to the original support for PS3 controllers.

Version 2.0
-----------

Simplified API, breaks compatibility with previous versions but allows for more pythonic access via property accessors
and overridden attribute access.

Version 1.0.7
-------------

Added support (pending documentation!) for the WiiMote controller, contributed once again by Keith Ellis! It also adds
controller disconnection detection, enabling :ref:`example_failover` .

Version 1.0.6
-------------

Minor tweak to fix some of the internals

Version 1.0.5
-------------

Added support for the Wii Remote Pro from Nintendo - I'd have added the WiiMote at this point as well but my cheap
clone was dead on arrival...

Version 1.0.4
-------------

Added support for the Steam Controller from Valve, although it needs an extra third party user space driver
(see :ref:`api_steamcontroller`)

Version 1.0.2
-------------

Added support for the Rock Candy PS3 clones thanks to Keith Ellis.
