    ThePiHut Controller

These are branded controllers that can be bought from thePiHut_. They use a dongle, but are functionally very
similar to the PS4 controllers, with analogue front triggers making them a step up in terms of controls from the Rock
Candy and similar.

Supported by code added by Mike Horne (`\@recantha <https://twitter.com/recantha>`__) from version 2.0.1 onwards.
